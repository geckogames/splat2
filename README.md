# splat2
splat2 is a recode of the fun game, SPLAT. SPLAT is a simple, arcade-style platformer game, in which you must squish slimes and get to the end of each level to win! What this recode is set to change includes:

 - Better Code
 - Better (and more consistent) Graphics
 - Animated Sprites
 - More Levels
 - Better Weapon Shop
 - More Songs
 - Fix Bad Bugs
 - Consistent FPS Rate
 - Full-page canvas
 - Easier to Contribute due to Reductionism & OOP
 - Etc.

Please keep in mind this game is a work in progress and is currently extremely early in development, so don't be disappointed when all you see is a green background. In any case, if you want to see the current progress, see https://rawgit.com/geckogames/splat2/develop/index.html.

We use waffle.io for issues. Please work in a branch other than gh-pages, our main branch. Run `npm i` after cloning to get set up, and run `npm run-script build` to build the coffeescript.
